# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a[1])

# The replace() method replaces a string with another string:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))   # Jello, World!

# The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.split(",")) #  ['Hello', ' World!']

# Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)

# Display the price with 2 decimals:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price:.2f} dollars"
print(txt)

txt = f"The price is {20 * 5} dollars"
print(txt)
