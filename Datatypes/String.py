# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a[1])

# The replace() method replaces a string with another string:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))   # Jello, World!

# The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.split(",")) #  ['Hello', ' World!']

# Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:

a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)
